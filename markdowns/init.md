# Installing the Angular cli
**you can skip this part and go directly to _The Application Module_ if you simply want to run all of the examples in this course online. This part is here if you want to start an Angular project on your own computer.**

The simplest way to get started with Angular is to use the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). It is a command line interface that helps you initialize a project, initialize modules and components, and serve your application on a local server for development purposes.

Once you have NPM set up, you can install the Angular CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then use the `new` command to bootstrap a project.

```bash
ng new awesome-project
```

This will run for a while and create a fully functionnal Angular project. If you want to run your app on a local server, use `ng serve`. Let's take a look at the folder structure:

```
awesome-project/
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   └── app.module.ts
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── environments/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── styles.css
└── tslint.json
```

Some files are not listed here because they are out of the scope of this course. Most of them are config files used to run tests with karma or protractor. I definitely recommend you look at them later, but for now, let's focus on:

* the `assets` folder, is the place you put your graphical assets, possibly some CSS sheets, and resources
* the `environments` folder has two files, a general config file and a production config file. You can use them to set different config values (like API tokens or log levels) between run environments
* `index.html` is the root HTML template for the page
* `main.ts` is the entry point for the application. It actually calls the AppModule we're going to study right now
* the `app` folder contains the sources for your app. This is where you will create your components. The best structure I have found so far is to create a `components` folder and then one subfolder per component, containing scripts, templates and styles for this component. The main file we are going to focus on right now is `app.module.ts`.

# The Application Module

Let's open `app.module.ts` and see what we've got:

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The first six lines are a bunch of imports. Mainly from the `@angular` packages, but note we also import the main component for our app, `AppComponent`.

The class `AppModule` has the `@NgModule` decorator, which makes it our Angular module. This module itself imports some other modules through its `imports` property. These modules are part of Angular, but you will use this property to import third-party modules or even your own if your app consists of separate modules.

`declarations` lists the components we are going to package with our app. Note that our main component `AppComponent` is included.

`providers` is used to register providers to the Dependency Injection System. We will examine this in detail in the next lessons.

Finally, `bootstrap` defines the entry point for the **module**, the component that will be used as the root of the module. The module itself is referenced in `main.ts` with the line:

```javascript
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

This declares that the main module of the app is going to be our `AppModule` class.

> An `@NgModule` in Angular 2 is very similar to the `angular.module()` in Angular 1, you use it to declare dependencies and components for your app.
